Welcome to an overview of the documentation provided for R-Type.
This page contains links to various helpful references. The goal
of this project is to implement a multithreaded server and a
graphical client for a well-known legacy video game called R-Type,
using our own game engine. The project lasted 2 months: in the first
one, we focused on the core architecture of the game and deliver a 
working prototype, and in a second month, we expanded several aspects
the prototype to the next level, exploring the network and game design
track. Our game engine implement the Entity Component System design
pattern for modularity purposes. You're invited to play our game.

## Supported Platform:

Our implementation of the R-Type is cross-platform. Therefore, it is available on `Windows` and `Linux` respectively via:<br/>
    - The [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler](https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=2081&q=Microsoft+visual+c%2B%2B&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzU2N2owajGoAgCwAgA&FORM=ANCMS9&PC=HCTS) <br/>
    - [GCC/G++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) <br/>

An [LLVM](https://clang.llvm.org/) support will be added later.
